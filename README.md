# Islam-Search.com
It is an Islamic search site where you can search for a sin that people do and see prophetic hadiths and Quranic verses that indicate whether this sin is permissible or forbidden. For example, you are committing a sin and you are not convinced that this is a sin and anyone who advises you is not convinced because you want Quranic verses and hadiths that indicate that this sin is forbidden. There is a friend of yours who has our site, so he writes the sin that you are committing and then brings you correct prophetic hadiths and correct Quranic verses and advice about that sin. If you commit this sin, there is a ruling on repentance on my site. It is very easy.
